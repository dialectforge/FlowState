# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Getting started
- AGENTS.md: setup snippets for VS Code (GitHub Copilot), Cline and Zed.
- `scripts/mcp-switch.py` finds the Claude Desktop config on Windows, macOS and Linux (the
  same way `setup_flowstate.py` does) and takes `--config PATH` for another file.

### For contributors
- CONTRIBUTING.md, and a GitHub Actions workflow that runs the tests on Windows, macOS and
  Linux with Python 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13.
- Package metadata: new description, project URLs, keywords and classifiers.

## 2.0.2 - 2026-10-17

### Working with your AI
- Shorter MCP tool and parameter descriptions. The `tools/list` payload is about 35% smaller
  for both the full list (35 tools) and the core list (9 tools). Every tool and every
  parameter still has a description. No change to tool behavior, names, or argument types.

## 2.0.1 - 2026-10-17

### Working with your AI
- Clearer tool and parameter descriptions. Every MCP tool says what it does, when to use a
  sibling tool instead, what a write changes and whether history can undo it, and what it
  returns. Every input parameter has a description (meaning, valid values, default, and which
  action uses it). No change to tool behavior, names, or argument types.

## 2.0.0 - 2026-10-17

FlowState 2 turns the v1.1 MCP server into a shared project memory that any AI app can use
safely, with you in charge of what gets saved. Existing v1.1 databases are upgraded in place
(backup first; new tables, plus new empty columns on FlowState's own v2 tables).

### Getting started
- `setup_flowstate.py`: one command (standard library only) creates the venv, sets up or
  upgrades the database, registers FlowState in Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code,
  Codex CLI, Grok Build or any `mcpServers` JSON config (backing up each config first), and can
  schedule backups, install the skill and verify the server answers. `--dry-run` shows what it
  would change; re-running is safe.
- `AGENTS.md` and `llms.txt`: an AI can install FlowState by itself from this repo.
- An Agent Skill (`skills/flowstate`) that teaches any AI the FlowState routine.

### Working with your AI
- `start_here`: a short project brief (quick, standard or deep) as the first call; with no
  project it lists them, or matches the working folder.
- `log_work`: one tool for decisions, changes, problems, learnings and todos.
- Every write must name a project; writes to the wrong project are refused with a clear error.
- Sessions open and close automatically (after 2 hours idle or when the app quits), with an
  auto-captured summary.
- The server tells every app how to use it when it connects, and offers the `flowstate-start` prompt.
- If FlowState is slow or its database is unavailable, the app gets a short "carry on" error
  instead of hanging.
- Tools are labelled read-only or read-write; `--tools core` lists only the 9 core tools.

### You decide what is kept
- Review queue for auto-captured summaries and suggested records: approve, edit or reject.
- Review mode (`off`, `auto_only`, chosen types, `everything`), per install or per project;
  only changed when you ask, and every change is logged.
- Hard rules per project, always shown first in the brief.
- Handoff notes ("where I was / next step") for the next AI.
- Edit history with undo, superseded decisions (`replaces=`), and where each record came from
  (`source=`), with a list of facts not checked for 60 days.
- Local review page in the browser (`flowstate review-page`, 127.0.0.1 only).
- Per-app activity log, and a pause switch for each app's writes.

### Accountability
- Every recorded change (edit history, review queue items and decisions, links, handoffs, hard
  rules, review-mode changes, activity log) also records the app, the AI model, the machine or
  workspace, and how the app was identified (`app_key`, `oauth_client`, `remote_token`,
  `shared_token`, `self_reported`).
- The model is recorded only when the app supplies it (the tool's `model` argument, the
  `X-FlowState-Model` header, or `FLOWSTATE_MODEL` for stdio); it is never guessed.
- The machine: for stdio, `FLOWSTATE_WORKSPACE` or the computer's name; for a LAN key, the key's
  workspace or the `X-FlowState-Workspace` header; for remote apps, the client's name. Stdio
  identity is self-reported.
- Per-app keys for the local/LAN HTTP server: `flowstate keys add --name N [--read-only]
  [--workspace W]`, `keys list`, `keys revoke --id ID | --name N`. The key is shown once and
  only a hash is kept; read-only keys can only read; revoked keys get 401. The old shared LAN
  token still works and its changes are labelled "shared token (legacy)". LAN keys are not
  accepted on the public listener, and are refused for `git` and file attach.
- "Who did what" on the review page: filter by app, model, machine, project and time, 50 per
  page, with an Undo button (CSRF and origin protected) that uses the normal undo. AIs can read
  it with `history(action="who", ...)`.
- Migration `012_accountability`: additive, new NULL columns only on FlowState's own v2 tables;
  existing data is unchanged and older rows show "not recorded".

### Projects and tasks
- Cross-project links: link a project to a shared component of another; a change to it gives
  every linked project an update todo and a "changed since you last looked" note.
- Links to GitHub, Linear or other URLs from any record.
- Todo priorities critical / urgent / normal / low (older names still accepted), subtasks,
  blockers and "what's next".
- Clean-up suggestions for duplicates, stale items and misfiled records, as review items.

### Finding and moving things
- Keyword search reads all record tables directly (word endings match); optional search by
  meaning with a local model you install.
- `ask`: answers a question by quoting your own records, with their ids.
- Markdown export of a project, and import of your edits through the review queue.
- Import of Claude or ChatGPT memory exports into the review queue.
- Opt-in git capture: new commit subjects become changes on a project.

### Safety and backups
- Writes that look like they contain keys, tokens, passwords or card numbers are refused;
  `flowstate scan-secrets` lists older records that look suspicious.
- The HTTP token lives in the OS credential store (Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain,
  or a 0600 file on Linux), not in a plain file.
- Nightly, integrity-checked local backups (14 daily + 8 weekly kept) through the OS scheduler;
  restore always into a new, verified file unless you force it.
- Optional off-site copy to a private GitHub repo you own; refused if the repo isn't private.
- Numbered, additive database migrations with a backup first.

### Connecting
- HTTP transport with a bearer token, alongside stdio.
- Optional remote access for cloud AIs through your own Cloudflare Tunnel: OAuth 2.1 approved
  with your owner passphrase, per-app tokens (optionally read-only), revocation, rate limits,
  and no `git` or file access for remote apps. See `docs/REMOTE-ACCESS.md`.

### Removed
- The v1.1 desktop GUI was an unfinished experiment and has been removed. v2 is used through
  your AI and the browser review page.

### Known limits
- See "Honest limits" in `README.md`.
